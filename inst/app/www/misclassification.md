Estimate of association can be biased if subjects are incorrectly categorized
with respect to their exposure status or outcome.
These errors are often referred to as misclassification, and the mechanism that
produces these errors can result in either non-differential or differential
misclassification.

For exposure misclassification, the misclassification is nondifferential if it
is unrelated to the occurrence or presence of disease; if the misclassification
of exposure is different for those with and without disease, it is differential.
Similarly, misclassification of disease [outcome] is nondifferential if it is
unrelated to the exposure; otherwise, it is differential.

#### Nondifferential Misclassification of Exposure

Nondifferential misclassification means that the frequency of errors is
approximately the same in the groups being compared.
Misclassification of exposure status is more of a problem than misclassification
of outcome, but a study may be biased by misclassification of either exposure
status, or outcome status, or both.

Nondifferential misclassification of a dichotomous exposure occurs when errors
in classification occur to the same degree regardless of outcome.
Nondifferential misclassification of exposure is a much more pervasive problem
than differential misclassification (in which errors occur with greater
frequency in one of the study groups).
