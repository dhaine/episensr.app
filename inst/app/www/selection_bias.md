Selection bias occurs when the subjects studied are not representative of the
target population about which conclusions are to be drawn.

Selection bias occurs when the study population is not representative of the
target population so that the measure of risks/benefits does not accurately
represent the target population to which conclusions are being extended.
Selection bias could occur because of an error in the procedure used to select
subjects or if there are other reasons that could explain why some participants
would want to participate in the study and not others, or if some participants
are more likely to be selected than others.

Selection bias occurs early on in epidemiology study during the recruitment of
participants and subsequently in the process of retaining the participants for
the duration of the study.
Once selection bias occurs not much can be done, but sensitivity analyses can be
performed.

To correct the bias, as such, it is especially important to ensure that
selection bias is avoided when recruiting and retaining the sample population.
